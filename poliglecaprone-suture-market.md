<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poliglecaprone Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dyed</li><li>Undyed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Poliglecaprone suture market is segmented into two main types: dyed and undyed sutures. Dyed poliglecaprone sutures are colored to enhance visibility during surgical procedures, making them preferable for specific applications where precision is critical. Undyed sutures, on the other hand, are preferred in situations where minimal tissue reaction and aesthetics are desired, as they remain virtually invisible post-operation. Both types are absorbable, providing effective wound closure while promoting healing, which drives their demand in surgical settings.</p></p>
